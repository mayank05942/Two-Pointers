Follow up of 2Sum less than k:

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
k = 7
count = 0


for left in range(len(arr)):
    right= len(arr)-1

    while left < right:
        
        s = arr[left]+arr[right]
        if s >= k:  # is sum is large reduce it
            right -= 1
        if s < k:  # if sum is less then reduce it further
            count = count + 1
            right -=1

        
print(count)
