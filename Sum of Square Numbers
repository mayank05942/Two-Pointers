Prob:

Since the search space of two numbers is sorted hence both binary search and two pointers can be used here.

Two Pointer Algo:

class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, num: int) -> bool:
        import math
        i = 0
        j = int(math.sqrt(num))   # i^2 + j^2 = num --> when i = 0 then j^2 = num ----> j = sqrt(num)
                                  # that's why j is sqrt(num)

        while i <= j:
            s = i**2 + j**2

            if s == num:
                return True
                break

            if s > num:
                j -= 1

            if s < num:
                i += 1
        return False
