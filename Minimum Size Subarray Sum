Based on Sliding Window Prob:  ---> size of the window changes dynamically

Prob: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/

Code:
import sys
from sys import maxsize
s = 280
nums = [1,11,100,1,0,200,3,2,1,250]
min_len = maxsize
start = 0
add = 0

for end in range(len(nums)):  # increasing the size of the window

    add += nums[end]  

    while add >= s and start <= end:
        min_len = min(min_len,end-start+1)
        add -= nums[start]             # shrinking the left hand side
        start += 1   # since this is the best we can do with the start idx we will change it now

print(min_len)
