Code:

class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        
        people.sort()
        i = 0
        j = len(people)-1
        
        count = 0
        while i <= j:
            s = people[i]+people[j] 

            # This is the case in which we can include two persons in a boat
            
            if s <= limit: # we will include heaviest and lightest person in the boat
                count += 1  # one boat
                i += 1   # since we have include one lighest person move ahead
                j -= 1   # again we gave included one heaviest persopn move below
                
            # if we cannot include two person we will include the heaviest one
            else:
                count += 1  # counting heaviest in
                j -= 1 # move below one
        return count
